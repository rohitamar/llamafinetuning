# Finetuning LLMs

The repository name is misleading. Contains different Jupyter notebooks with finetuning and exploring huggingface's extensive API for using tokenizers and inference through LLMs. Initially, I tried using Eleuther AI's GPT-Neo-2.7B, but zero-shot prompting on SST2 didn't work. Then, I tried llama-2-7b-chat, and it got around ~90% accuracy on SST2. So, I don't think there's much point on finetuning that Llama model for SST2.
